   abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is an augmented depiction of reality formed by overlaying digital information on an image of objects being seen through a device. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have experienced unprecedented growth and are being applied in various industries. The combination of AR and AI is the next prominent direction in upcoming years with many industries and academia recognizing the importance of their adoption. With the advancements in the silicone industry that push the boundaries of Moore's law, processors will be less expensive, more efficient, and power-optimized in the forthcoming years. This is a tremendous support and necessity for an AR boom, and with the help of AI, there is an excellent potential for smart industries to increase the production speed and workforce training along with improved manufacturing, error handling, assembly, and packaging. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent advances, tools, techniques, and platforms of AI-empowered AR along with the challenges of using AI in AR applications. This paper will serve as a guideline for future research in the domain of AI-assisted AR in industrial applications.},

   abstract = {Assistance is becoming increasingly relevant in carrying out industrial work in the context of cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) and Industry 4.0. While assistance in a single task via a single interaction modality has been explored previously, crossdevice interaction could improve the quality of assistance, especially given the concurrent and distributed nature of work in CPPSs. In this paper, we present the theoretical foundations and implementation of MiWSICx (Middleware for Work Support in Industrial Contexts), a middleware that showcases how multiple interactive computing devices such as tablets, smartphones, augmented/virtual reality glasses, and wearables could be combined to provide crossdevice industrial assistance. Based on activity theory, MiWSICx models human work as activities combining multiple users, artifacts, and cyber-physical objects. MiWSICx is developed using the actor model for deployment on a variety of hardware alongside a CPPS to provide multiuser, crossdevice, multiactivity assistance.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the quality control of car body surfaces production lines have been put in the context of Industry 4.0. The emergence of automatic defect detection systems have helped to standardize the brand quality and gather information about all quality control tasks performed by workers. However, current worker interfaces used to indicate the location and other characteristics of the defects found by these systems have overcome the ergonomics of workers and increased their stress at work. This paper presents a novel mixed reality-based user interface for quality control inspection which is more intuitive, in order to improve the ergonomics of workers, reduce their stress at work and improve the productivity of current quality control production lines. An experimental prototype is shown in the paper in order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed interface. In addition, the paper shows the results of several usability tests that compare the proposed mixed reality-based user interface with current interfaces used in important factories such as Mercedes-Benz, analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of each interface.},

   abstract = {Quality and efficiency are crucial indicators of any manufacturing company. Many companies are suffering from a shortage of experienced workers across the production line to perform complex assembly tasks. To reduce time and error in an assembly task, a worker-centered system consisting of multi-modal Augmented Reality (AR) instructions with the support of a deep learning network for tool detection is introduced. The integrated AR is designed to provide on-site instructions including various visual renderings with a fine-tuned Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained on a synthetic tool dataset. The dataset is generated using CAD models of tools and displayed onto a 2D scene without using real tool images. By experimenting the system to a mechanical assembly of a CNC carving machine, the result of a designed experiment shows that the system helps reduce the time and errors of the given assembly tasks by 33.2 % and 32.4 %, respectively. With the integrated system, an efficient, customizable smart AR instruction system capable of sensing, characterizing requirements, and enhancing worker's performance has been built and demonstrated.},

@article{Simonetto2022,
   abstract = {Nowadays new products are required more and more often. Since a certain product is assembled only on a specific Assembly System (AS), a new AS has to be designed every time a new product is developed. Similarly, since an AS is constituted by one or more workplaces, new workplaces need to be designed every time a new product is developed. However, this is not feasible considering the time- and resource-consuming AS workplace design procedures currently used (e.g., physical mock-ups and computer-aided systems). New solutions have thus emerged to accelerate the AS workplace design procedures, especially since the advent of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. Specifically, the combined use of motion capture (mocap) systems and Virtual Reality (VR) has been considered very promising, with many researchers showing its potential. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of them suggests a clear methodology to follow when designing AS workplaces using the mocap system and VR. In this paper, we thus aim to fill this gap by developing a methodological framework that describes in detail the different steps to be followed. Moreover, the methodological framework has been developed in such a way that both productivity and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) considerations are included. Furthermore, it encompasses the current ageing workforce scenario by explicitly including the ageing workforce's main characteristics (reduced flexibility and strength and greater experience of older operators). A simple but representative case study has then been carried out to demonstrate how to use the methodological framework and to prove its validity.},
